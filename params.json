{"name":"CLDR Plural Rule Parser","tagline":"CLDR Plural Rule Parser","body":"CLDR Plural Rule Evaluator\r\n==========================\r\nFind out the plural form for a given number in a language\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nQuick start\r\n----------\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone https://github.com/santhoshtr/CLDRPluralRuleParser.git\r\n```\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n----------\r\n\r\nUnlike English, for many languages, the plural forms are just not 2 forms.\r\nIf you look at the <a href=\"http://unicode.org/repos/cldr-tmp/trunk/diff/supplemental/language_plural_rules.html#pl\">CLDR plural rules table</a>\r\nyou can easily understand this. The rules are defined in a particular syntax\r\n(an eg: for Russian, the plural few is applied when the rule\r\n\"`n mod 10 in 2..4 and n mod 100 not in 12..14;`\" is passed).\r\n\r\nThis tool is a demonstration of a <a href=\"cldrpluralparser.js\">javascript parser</a>\r\nfor the plural rules in that syntax.\r\n\r\nFor a given number in a language, this tool tells which plural form it belongs.\r\nThe plural rules are taken from the CLDR  data file (<a href=\"plural.xml\">plural.xml</a>.\r\n\r\nSee a demonstration of the javascript parser at:\r\nhttp://thottingal.in/projects/js/plural/\r\n\r\nTest\r\n----------\r\n\r\nBefore you can run the tests, make sure the submodules are updated:\r\n```\r\ngit submodule update --init\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen open up `./test/index.html` in your browser.\r\n\r\nVersioning\r\n----------\r\n\r\nFor transparency and insight into the release cycle, and to upgrading easier,\r\nwe use the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible.\r\n\r\nReleases will be numbered with the following format:\r\n\r\n`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`\r\n\r\nAnd constructed with the following guidelines:\r\n\r\n* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)\r\n* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor (and resets the patch)\r\n* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch\r\n\r\nFor more information on SemVer, please visit http://semver.org/.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
